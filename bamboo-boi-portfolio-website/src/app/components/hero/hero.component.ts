I\'m a coding panda with serious development skills (and a serious bamboo addiction). üíª I specialize in crafting delightful web experiences during my few waking hours between naps. üò¥ My work schedule?

When I\'m not pushing commits, you\'ll find me rolling down hills or practicing the ancient panda art of looking cute while doing absolutely nothing.';
