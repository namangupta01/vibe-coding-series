        "Transformer architecture. Apart from the details mentioned below and the variants we explore in Section 3.2, we do not deviate significantly from this architecture as originally proposed. Instead of providing a comprehensive definition of this model, we refer the interested reader to the original paper (Vaswani et al., 2017) or follow-up tutorials3,4for a more detailed introduction. The primary building block of the Transformer is self-attention (Cheng et al., 2016). Self-attention is a variant of attention (Graves, 2013; Bahdanau et al., 2015) that processes a sequence by replacing each element by a weighted average of the rest of the sequence. The original Transformer consisted of an encoder-decoder architecture and was intended for sequence-to-sequence (Sutskever et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) tasks. It has recently also become common to use models consisting of a single Transformer layer stack, with varying forms of self-attention used to produce architectures",
        "in Figure 1 will serve as a running example for this section. A distinctive feature of BERT is its uni\ufb01ed architecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architecture and the \ufb01nal downstream architecture. Model Architecture BERT\u2019s model architecture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder based on the original implementation described in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in thetensor2tensor library.1Because the use of Transformers has become common and our implementation is almost identical to the original, we will omit an exhaustive background description of the model architecture and refer readers to Vaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides such as \u201cThe Annotated Transformer.\u201d2 In this work, we denote the number of layers (i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as H, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3 We primarily report results on two model sizes: BERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Parameters=110M)",

When producing the ith entry of the output sequence, causal masking prevents the model from attending to the jth entry of the input sequence for j >i. This is used during training so that the model can\u2019t \u201csee into the future\u201d as it produces its output. An attention matrix for this masking pattern is shown in Figure 3, middle. The decoder in an encoder-decoder Transformer is used to autoregressively produce an output sequence. That is, at each output timestep, a token is sampled from the model\u2019s predicted distribution and the sample is fed back into the model to produce a prediction for the next output timestep, and so on. As such, a Transformer decoder (without an encoder) can be used as a language model (LM), i.e. a model trained solely for next-step prediction (Liu et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Al-Rfou et al., 2019).

We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training. 4 Why Self-Attention In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi\u2208Rd, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder.

The self-attention mechanism in the decoder also uses a form of autoregressive or causal selfattention, which only allows the model to attend to past outputs.

All attention mechanisms in the Transformer are split up into independent \u201cheads\u201d whose outputs are concatenated before being further processed. Since self-attention is order-independent (i.e. it is an operation on sets), it is common to provide an explicit position signal to the Transformer. While the original Transformer used a sinusoidal position signal or learned position embeddings, it has recently become more common to use relative position embeddings (Shaw et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018a). Instead of using a fixed embedding for each position, relative position embeddings produce a different learned embedding according to the",
        "as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution.

Masked Language Model (MLM) A random sample of the tokens in the input sequence is selected and replaced with the special token [MASK]. The MLM objective is a cross-entropy loss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uniformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possible replacement.

First, we include a basic \u201cprefix language modeling\u201d objective as was used in Section 3.2.3. This technique splits a span of text into two components, one to use as inputs to the encoder and the other to use as a target sequence to be predicted by the decoder. Second, we consider an objective inspired by the \u201cmasked language modeling\u201d (MLM) objective used in BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). MLM takes a span of text and corrupts 15%of the tokens. 90%of the corrupted tokens are replaced with a special mask token and 10%are replaced with a random token. Since BERT is an encoder-only model, its goal during pre-training is to reconstruct masked tokens at the output of the encoder. In the encoder-decoder case, we simply use the entire uncorrupted sequence as the target. Note that this differs from our baseline objective, which uses only the corrupted tokens as targets; we compare these two",

We now aggregate these improvements and evaluate their combined impact. We call this con\ufb01guration RoBERTa for Robustly optimized BERT approach. Speci\ufb01cally, RoBERTa is trained with dynamic masking (Section 4.1),FULL -SENTENCES without NSP loss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3) and a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4). Additionally, we investigate two other important factors that have been under-emphasized in previous work: (1) the data used for pretraining, and (2) the number of training passes through the data. For example, the recently proposed XLNet architecture ( Yang et al. ,2019 ) is pretrained using nearly 10 times more data than the original BERT ( Devlin et al. ,2019 ). It is also trained with a batch size eight times larger for half as many optimization steps, thus seeing four times as many sequences in"

This constitutes the second model structure we consider. A schematic of this architecture is shown in Figure 4, middle. In fact, early work on transfer learning for NLP used this architecture with a language modeling objective as a pre-training method (Radford et al., 2018). Language models are typically used for compression or sequence generation (Graves, 2013). However, they can also be used in the text-to-text framework simply by concatenating the inputs and targets. As an example, consider the case of English to German translation: If we have a training datapoint with input sentence \u201cThat is good.\u201d and target \u201cDas ist gut.\u201d, we would simply train the model on next-step prediction over the concatenated input sequence \u201ctranslate English to German: That is good. target: Das ist gut.\u201d If we wanted to 16 Exploring the Limits of Transfer",

As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences. 5 Training This section describes the training regime for our models. 5.1 Training Data and Batching We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were",

In this section, we review and compare these architectural variants. 3.2.1 Model Structures A major distinguishing factor for different architectures is the \u201cmask\u201d used by different attention mechanisms in the model. Recall that the self-attention operation in a Transformer takes a sequence as input and outputs a new sequence of the same length.

Specifically, let yirefer to the ith element of the output sequence and xjrefer to thejth entry of the input sequence. yiis computed as/summationtext jwi,jxj, wherewi,jis the scalar weight produced by the"
